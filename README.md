# Machine Learning Design Pattern
Design patterns are standard and recommended ways that programmers can use to address typical issues while developing a system or application.

## Rebalancing: Problem Representation 
•	Choosing the right performance metric:
  o	Balanced Data: Accuracy
  o	Imbalanced Data: Precision, recall, F1 score, AUC
•	Sampling methods:
  o	Over-sampling
  o	Down-sampling
•	Weighted classes
