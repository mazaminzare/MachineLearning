# Machine Learning Design Pattern
Design patterns are standard and recommended ways that programmers can use to address typical issues while developing a system or application.

## Rebalancing: Problem Representation 
**Choosing the right performance metric:**

    	Balanced Data: Accuracy
    	Imbalanced Data: Precision, recall, F1 score, AUC
        
**Sampling methods:**

    	Over-sampling
    	Down-sampling
        
**Weighted classes**

        Penalized learning algorithms
 
## Transform: Reproducibility Design Pattern
**Separate input from features**

        Extract features from raw input
    
**Transformation and Preprocessing:**

        	Standardization
        	Scaling
        	Encoding
