# Machine Learning Design Pattern
Design patterns are standard and recommended ways that programmers can use to address typical issues while developing a system or application.

## Rebalancing: Problem Representation 
**Choosing the right performance metric:**

    	Balanced Data: Accuracy
  
    	Imbalanced Data: Precision, recall, F1 score, AUC
  
**Sampling methods:**

    	Over-sampling
  
    	Down-sampling
  
**Weighted classes**
